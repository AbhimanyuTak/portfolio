              Hi, I am Abhimanyu. I build softwares for a living and is curious about life in general.

              I fuel my creativity with a pinch of caffeine and some rock n roll music. When not working I would be chilling around local caf√©s or trying to find motivation to learn that guitar solo I have been dreaming about.

              Wanna go for a music gig , jam over a campfire or a bike tour? Hit me up.
