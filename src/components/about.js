        <p>Hello! I am Abhimanyu.</p>
        <p>
          A software engineer by profession who is curious about life and learning new technologies. I fuel my creativity with some touch of caffeine and rock n roll music.
        </p>
        <p>
          When not working I would be chilling around local caf√©s or trying to find motivation to learn that guitar solo I have been dreaming about.
        </p>

          Wanna go for a music gig or a bike tour? Hit me up.
